	I thought of this app when I was helping a friend close a grocery store. It was a lot easier to count the number of bills enter them in the app and then you get the total. Itâ€™s really useful and counting a large amount of money. We also added coins to be calculated.  Complete time saver for cashier or managers adding up the shift totals.
